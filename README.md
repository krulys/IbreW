## How to contribute
The project currently has poor code coverage. make sure to run the few tests that are available. I would suggest just running the application and testing your implemented feature from the UI

to run the tests, from the project root directory run `source/test_units.py` using `python` or `python3` 
(depending on your python setup, but make sure you are using version ≥ 3.0) 

Make sure to have reasonable commit messages and comment any complex pieces of code
